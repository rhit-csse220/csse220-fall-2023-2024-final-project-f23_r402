b. Fitness calculation function
    At the moment, Chromosome.calcFitnessFunction() calculates the fitness score
    with N operations, meaning that its Big-O is O(N).
    
    Theoretically, it can be improved to O(1) if Chromosome.fitnessScore is calculated
    automatically in every method that changes the fitness score. Currently, these
    methods rely on calling Chromosome.calcFitnessFunction() at the end, but we can change
    it and improve efficiency.


c. Roulette wheel selection function
    Fist, Population.sortPopulation() performs at O(NlogN)
    Second, Population.createLine() - O(numberOfChromosomes + numberOfChromosomes + sizeOfPopulation)
                                    = O(M + N)
    Third, Population.findRouletteList() - O((M + M + M + M) * numberOfRecursions)
    Then, O(elitismPercentage)
    Then, O(M / 2)
    Then, O(elitismPercentage)
    Then, O(NlogN)
